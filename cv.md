 ## About Myself:

 In my youth, I was attracted to the profession of a proIn my youth, I was drawn to the profession of a programmer, however, I pursued a different education and graduated from university as an electrical supply designer.
 After graduating, I made another attempt to enroll in Delphi courses, but once again, circumstances did not favor programming. The third attempt was almost successful - I acquired basic knowledge of html, css, and the fundamentals of javaScript. 
 Now I am continuing to learn and hope that my new knowledge will be useful to me in my future profession.

## Code example:

*To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

volume = Length * Width * Height

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.

Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: side will be an integer*

```
var cubeChecker = function(volume, side){
  if (side <= 0 || volume <= 0 || side ** 3 !== volume) { 
    return false;
  } else return true;
    
}; 
```
